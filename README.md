# Mouse Arrow Interaction

An interactive web effect that creates a high-performance trail of arrows following your mouse cursor or touch input with a subtle glow effect. Optimized for instant loading and smooth animations on all devices.

## Features

- Custom mouse cursor with ambient glow effect
- Highly optimized arrow trail animation (60+ FPS)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Advanced touch support for mobile devices
- Near-zero loading time with preloading
- Hardware-accelerated animations for smooth performance
- Progressive performance optimizations
- Memory-efficient object pooling
- Smart throttling for consistent frame rates
- Automatic performance adjustments based on device capabilities

## Performance Optimizations

- **Pre-rendering**: All arrows are pre-created at initialization
- **Object Pooling**: Efficient reuse of DOM elements
- **GPU Acceleration**: Hardware-accelerated transforms with `translate3d` and `will-change`
- **Visibility API**: Pauses animations when tab is inactive
- **Critical Path Rendering**: Inline critical CSS for instant display
- **Asynchronous Loading**: Non-critical resources load after render
- **Smart Throttling**: Frame rate management for smooth visuals
- **Batch DOM Operations**: Minimizes browser reflows
- **Resource Hints**: Preload, prefetch, and preconnect for faster loading
- **Memory Management**: Comprehensive cleanup and leak prevention

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Move your mouse (or touch on mobile) to see the arrow effect in action. The effect will work smoothly on both desktop and mobile browsers with minimal CPU/GPU usage.

## Compatibility

- Works with all modern browsers
- Optimized for mobile devices
- Degrades gracefully on older browsers
- Touch-enabled for tablets and touchscreens
